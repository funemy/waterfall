This is a first stable version of my waterfall website for display students' design 
after one-week debugging.

The problem remains to be fixed:

    1. measure where to add new waterblocks by the height of column

    2. able to show different number of detail pictures

    3. be more effective

    4. add more animation to make some transition process more soft.
